# Open hypotheses

Each is a claim to verify, mostly carried from
`/root/p100_inference_knowledge_handover.md`, which predates the current engine
builds. **Treat every one as unproven until a run in this repo confirms it.**

Update the Status line when a run bears on a hypothesis, and reference the
run label so the evidence is traceable.

| ID | Claim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | MTP wins bigger on P100 than on a 3090 | Untested |
| H2 | XL quants stall one GPU on the split | Untested |
| H3 | Stock quants below Q6 degrade on `ssm_out` | Untested |
| H4 | TurboQuant KV avoids the q4_0 KV penalty | Untested |
| H5 | NCCL is harmful for split inference | **Partly confirmed — worse than claimed** |
| H6 | `-sm graph` is the best split mode | Untested (blocked by H5) |
| H7 | `(turbo*, F16)` KV combo aborts | Untested |

## H1 — MTP win size

**Claim:** MTP should give a *larger* relative speedup on P100 than the ~1.7×
reported for Qwen3.6-27B on a 3090 (38 → 65 t/s).

**Reasoning:** MTP trades compute for bandwidth — N draft tokens verified per
weight read. The P100 is severely bandwidth-bound and has a 2:1 FP16 rate that
the batched verification path exercises well.

**Test:** tg128 with vs without MTP, same engine/quant/split. Record acceptance
rate alongside throughput — a speedup without a plausible acceptance rate is a
measurement error, not a win.

**Status:** Untested. Requires Phase 2. MTP draft head is on disk and verified
(`nextn_predict_layers = 1`).

---

## H2 — XL quant split-stall

**Claim:** `-XL` quants upcast the embedding and output head to Q8_0. Those
tensors can't be split, so they land entirely on one GPU and stall the other
during prefill. XL is claimed to be *strictly better* on a single GPU.

**Why it matters:** determines whether XL quants are usable at all in the
dual-GPU configuration, which is the whole point of this rig.

**Test:** `Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL.gguf` on `-sm layer` and `-sm row` with
telemetry running. Look for one device sitting at low utilization during the
prefill phase while the other saturates. Compare against `UD-Q4_K_M` on the
same split as the control.

The evidence should be numeric — per-GPU utilization from
`logs/<label>.temps.log`, not an impression. Explicitly requested as
"proof, not trust me."

**Status:** Untested. Model on disk.

## H3 — Stock quant degradation below Q6

**Claim:** Non-dynamic ("stock") quants below Q6 degrade disproportionately on
Gated Delta Network / `ssm_out` layers. Unsloth Dynamic quants are claimed
exempt.

**Test:** `Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-noMTP-Q4_K_M.gguf` (stock) vs
`Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf` (dynamic). **This is a quality comparison, not a
speed one** — throughput will be near-identical and is not the question.

Needs a coherence/perplexity measure, not `llama-bench`. Define the measure
before running, and note that the two models differ in more than quantizer
(one is an "Uncensored" fine-tune), so this is suggestive rather than clean.

**Status:** Untested. Confounded comparison — see caveat above.

---

## H4 — TurboQuant KV penalty

**Claim (open question, not an assertion):** f16 KV was previously mandatory on
these cards — q4_0 KV cost 31–58%. But TurboQuant computes directly on
quantized values rather than dequantizing per access, so it may not inherit
that penalty.

**Test:** same engine/quant/split, sweeping `-ctk`/`-ctv` across `f16`,
`q8_0`, and the turbo types. Watch for the H7 dispatch bug when choosing
combinations.

**Status:** Untested.

---

## H5 — NCCL harmful for split inference

**Claim:** NCCL is actively harmful (−14% on a MoE model) for `ik_llama`'s
split path. No NVLink means direct CUDA peer-to-peer beats AllReduce over
PCIe. Original guidance: "do not build with NCCL."

**Status: partly confirmed, and the reality is worse than the claim.**

On the current build (`8337e4c`), NCCL doesn't merely cost performance — it
**fails outright**:

```
ggml_cuda_op_reduce: ncclAllReduce failed with status 1
/root/ik_llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-cuda/reduce.cu:169: Fatal error
```

Aborts on the first prefill test, before producing any throughput number.
`GGML_NCCL` defaults to **ON** in ik_llama's CMake, so this is the default
build's behaviour on this rig.

Evidence: `logs/phase0-ik-graph-q6k.log` (run `phase0-ik-graph-q6k`).

**Remaining work:**
1. Rebuild ik_llama with `-DGGML_NCCL=OFF` and confirm `-sm graph` runs.
2. Quantify the performance claim properly — that needs a working NCCL build
   to compare against, which may not be achievable if NCCL simply doesn't
   function here. If so, record that the −14% figure is untestable on this rig
   and the operative guidance is "NCCL is unusable," which is stronger.
3. Check whether this affects `pflash`/`buun` at all — the original finding was
   specific to `ik`'s graph mode, and those engines don't offer graph split.

## H6 — Best split mode overall

**Claim:** `ik_llama`'s `-sm graph` was the prior known-good baseline for this
rig (on the much older build `286ce324`).

**Question:** does graph split still win on current builds once MTP is factored
in? `pflash`/`buun` don't have graph split at all, so if MTP is the bigger
lever, the engine choice may flip.

**Test:** Phase 1 establishes the no-MTP baseline across engines and split
modes; Phase 2 re-tests with MTP. The comparison that matters is the
*combination*, not either axis alone.

**Status:** Untested — `-sm graph` is blocked by H5. `none`/`layer` comparisons
can proceed on all three engines meanwhile.

---

## H7 — Known FATTN dispatch bug

**Claim:** the `FATTN_VEC_CASE` dispatch table has `(F16, turbo*)` but not the
reverse `(turbo*, F16)`. So asymmetric KV types abort:

```bash
--cache-type-k turbo3 --cache-type-v f16     # aborts at fattn.cu:348
--cache-type-k turbo3 --cache-type-v turbo3  # works
--cache-type-k turbo3 --cache-type-v q8_0    # works
```

**Test:** confirm present or absent on each of the three current trees before
relying on any asymmetric turbo KV configuration. This is a cheap check — the
abort happens early, so it doesn't need a full benchmark run.

**Status:** Untested on current builds. The claim was made against a different
fork and may not apply to all three.
